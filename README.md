# The Fallout TV Show
**One of my favorite TV series to ever have the pleasure of viewing**

This show is by far one of the best attempts of a Hollywood studio dipping their toes into the rich well of immersive and cinematic video game experiences. There have been many TV shows that have attempted to do the same but only few have captured the **true essence** and **magic** of these games. One of the most notable example of a good video game adaptation is *The Last of Us* by Naughty Dog studios. It managed to mirror the same concepts and ideas of an interactive medium into the big screen and it did so amazingly featuring stellar casting, acting, writing and world-building.
With all of these said, I am happy to say that *The Fallout* TV show has exceeded well above my expectations and it is definitely one of the best video game adaptations to date.
